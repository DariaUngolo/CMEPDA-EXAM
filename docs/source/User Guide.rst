Once the CMEPDA-EXAM project is set up, you can start using it with the following steps:

1. Run the main script to launch the application:
   .. code-block:: bash

       python main.py

2. The script will process the NIfTI images from the specified input directory and output classification results.

3. You can customize the classification model used by editing the configuration file (`config.json`) in the root directory.

4. For detailed usage of the implemented models and pipelines:
   - Refer to the **API Reference** section for a breakdown of available functions and their parameters.
   - Explore the example scripts in the `examples/` directory for practical use cases.

If you encounter any issues, consult the **Contributing** section to report them.
