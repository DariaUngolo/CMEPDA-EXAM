=============
This folder contains the main scripts used to run the classification pipelines.

- ``main.py``: Script for executing machine learning classifiers, including training and prediction.
- ``CNN_main.py``: Script for training and testing convolutional neural network (CNN) models.

These scripts manage data input, model selection, training, and evaluation workflows.
