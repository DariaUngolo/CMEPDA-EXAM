Introduction
============

CMEPDA-EXAM is a classification project aimed at distinguishing subjects with Alzheimerâ€™s disease from those without, using brain imaging data.
The dataset consists of 333 NIfTI brain scans. 
The project utilizes the BN_Atlas_246_LUT, a brain atlas that divides the brain into distinct regions of interest (ROIs), to extract meaningful features for classification.

The implemented classification models include Random Forest and its variants, as well as Support Vector Machines (SVM).
 This project combines neuroimaging data processing with machine learning techniques to improve diagnostic accuracy.
